TwDataCollector
===============

Twitter Data Collector provide an interface to get the last followers and the last tweets for a specific user.

It is used for me to collect data to do a BDML project.

You need install:
* requests_oauthlib: pip install requests_oauthlib

To run the script you must run on your console:
$ python collect_data.py
